# Git Release Action Test Repository

This repository is used for end-to-end testing of the [git-release-action](https://github.com/LiquidLogicLabs/git-release-action).

## Purpose

This repository exists solely for automated testing purposes. It may contain test releases, tags, and other artifacts created during E2E test runs.

## Test Releases

Test releases created by E2E tests are automatically cleaned up after each test run. If you see releases with tags like `test-e2e-*`, these are from automated test executions.

## Repository Status

This repository is maintained by the git-release-action development team and should not be used for production purposes.
